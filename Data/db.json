                "Make some room in the bottom of the pot (there won't be much room, do your best) and add in the chicken to get some browning. Cook it for 3-4 minutes. Flipping over when ready.",
                "While the vegetables and chicken are cooking you can prepare your sauce. Mix together the soy sauce, honey, gochujang, and gochugaru. These are Korean ingredients. I get them at Whole Foods, you may be able to find them at your regular store and certainly at your local asian grocer. If you don't love spicy food, add less gochugaru. If you can't find gochugaru you can substitute ground chili powder (the one that is just ground chili, not the chili powder mixture with cumin etc.)",

                "After 20 minutes, remove the lid, stir the contents of the pot and taste. Season with salt and pepper to taste. When I made this recipe I used chicken bone broth which is a tad bit thicker than regular stock. The starch from the potatoes should help to thicken the sauce. If you still have a very watery consistency, you can either add a small amount of a cornstarch slurry or allow the pot to boil with the lid off to boil off some of the water.",
                "This recipe makes 6 servings. Each dish gets ¾ cup of rice and you can divide the stew evenly between the 6 containers. Top each dish with the chopped green onions."
